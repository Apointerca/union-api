## General HTTP status code
As HTTP status code contains a lot of information, here we demonstration some of them so we can use them directly in our response.  

### 200
This is the most common status code. It basically means things are going well.  
But usually it returns together with response body.  
Mostly for `GET` request.  

### 201
This status code indicates the requested resource has been created.  
Response body should be returned together.  
Mostly for `POST` request.  

### 204
Similar to `200`, but nothing would come together with this status.  
Mostly for `DELETE` and `PUT` requests.  

## General HTTP status error code

To avoid redundent error code declaration, here we list all the default meaning of corresponding error code.  
Please explicitly in each response if the response is different from what state here.  

### 400
Malformed request, this request is reported.  
### 401
This request is not authorized.  
### 403
This request doesn't have permission to access the resource.  
### 404
The target resource not found.  
### 405
HTTP request method not found.  
### 406
The request parameters and headers not acceptable.  
Please change it according to documentation.
